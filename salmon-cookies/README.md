# JS Framework Comparative Analysis

## Framework Name (Angular)

### Research Conducted By: Sian Culligan, Blandine Dasilveira, Shubham Majumda, Daniel Nguyen

### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 6
#### General Comments
The platform was quick to launch and had lots of cool features. It was similar enough to React that we kind of knew what was going on. It's like learning to speak Italian after learning to speak French. 

#### Pros
* Great support from Google, and integration with Material UI
* Really easy to make new components

#### Cons
* The components come with many files, so it's easy to get lost 
* The documentation and tutorials are not great, although there are many of them

### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
The documentation looks fantastic until you start trying to follow the directions only to have the documentation guide you through a broken tutorial.

#### Systems Requirements
You will need to download Angular and Material UI.

#### Ramp-Up Projections
It took us about 8 hours to make a half-working app. I imagine if we had a proper work week, we could have figured out how to build something real. 

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
This framework is very popular and has support from one of the world's largest companies. So it's safe to say it isn't going to disappear soon.
